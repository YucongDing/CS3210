![Site Addr](https://tc.gts3.org/cs3210/2020/spring/index.html)

## General Info
CS-3210 is primarily intended for senior students (motivated junior students) and graduate students who want to concentrate on systems. To benefit from the course, low-level programming skills (e.g., C or ASM programming) and preliminary knowledge on computer system (e.g., CS 2200) and architecture (e.g., CS 2110). You will be asked to design and implement core components of an operating system through labs, assignments and a final project.

## Prerequisite
* C programming (strict)
* CS 2200 - Systems and Networks (strict)
* CS 2110 - Computer Organization and Programming (recommended)
* CS 3220 - Processor Design (recommended)
